# Hearing and Sound Lesson Module

A collaborative, interactive lesson module on the anatomy of the human ear and the physics of sound. This resource is designed for middle school science classrooms (grades 6-8) but can be adapted for other grade levels.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify the three main parts of the ear (outer ear, middle ear, inner ear) and describe their functions.
- Label the major structures of the ear (pinna, ear canal, eardrum, ossicles, cochlea, auditory nerve).
- Define key sound properties: frequency, amplitude, wavelength, and pitch.
- Explain how sound waves travel through different mediums and are converted into neural signals in the ear.
- Draw and interpret simple sound wave diagrams to represent high vs. low pitch and loud vs. soft sounds.
