## Part 2: Properties of Sound

### A. Definitions
Match each term with its correct definition.

| Term       | Definition |
|------------|------------|
| Frequency  | a. The height of a sound wave; determines loudness. |
| Amplitude  | b. The number of vibrations per second; determines pitch. |
| Wavelength | c. The distance between two consecutive compressions. |
| Pitch      | d. How high or low a sound seems. |
| Loudness   | e. How soft or loud a sound seems. |

### B. Drawing Sound Waves

1. **High pitch, low amplitude** (soft high sound)  
   Draw a sound wave with many cycles (high frequency) but small height (low amplitude).

   ```
   (Draw your wave here)
   ```

2. **Low pitch, high amplitude** (loud low sound)  
   Draw a sound wave with fewer cycles (low frequency) but large height (high amplitude).

   ```
   (Draw your wave here)
   ```

### C. True or False
Indicate whether each statement is true (T) or false (F).

___ 1. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum.  
___ 2. The cochlea is part of the middle ear.  
___ 3. Increasing the amplitude of a sound wave makes it louder.  
___ 4. Frequency is measured in decibels.  
___ 5. The auditory nerve carries signals from the ear to the brain.

## Part 3: Critical Thinking

1. Suppose a person has a damaged eardrum. How might this affect their hearing?

2. Explain why you can hear sounds underwater, but they sound different than in air.

3. **Optional Challenge:** Research how a hearing aid works. Describe one way it helps people with hearing loss.
